# AVRDudeDeviceParser
Generates avrdude.conf part entries from Atmel Device XML files.

I’ve just started this, not even sure it’ll get anywhere.

The ideas is to build a web page that can be served from GitHub that can parse Atmel AVR part definition XML files, and generate suitable entries for [avrdude](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/).
